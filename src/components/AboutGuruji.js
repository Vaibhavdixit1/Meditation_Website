          The complex term “neurocognitive srividya” refers to a combined system
          of ancient spiritual ideas with a modern understanding of how the mind
          works. Srividya represents the mysterious teachings resulting from the
          worship of the Divine Feminine, represented as Sri or Lalita
          Tripurasundari. The transformation process uses neurocognition
          principles from medical science. Neurocognition represents all that
          happens in human life, whether it is success and happiness or failure
          and misery. The supramental approach means that the reality of life
          can be changed with changes in thinking that result in a conscious
          elevated awareness.
